var about = "<div>\
<p>\
I am a creative and driven developer from Venezuela, that has had experience in the fields of engineering and finance. My foundation as an industrial engineer has sharpened my analytical and problem solving skills and has molded the way I tackle new obstacles. My studies in finance have honed my understanding of the business side of things and has given me the tools to be able to successfully start a business of my own web based business in my home country destined to solve the difficulties of finding professional service providers.\
</p>\
<p>\
My first work experience introduced me to web development, giving me the opportunity to become part of UX design teams and implement new and creative ways of optimizing user usability and experience in the company's website.  Later on, working as a monitoring coordinator for machinery software I was presented with the opportunity to  lead a web based project where I was able to work hand in hand with web developers and designers, ultimately leading to my interest in the tech industry.\
</p>\
<p>\
Ever since, I have dedicated all of my time and energy to gain the required knowledge needed to fully understand how to bring my ideas to life through code and tackle larger and more complex projects. Through my courses at Columbia and the completion of a 19 week developer bootcamp I am certain I have achieved this goal.\
</p>\
<p>\
Im driven by the need to elevate the quality of life through tech based undertakings and demonstrate the dynamism of tech in fields that have yet to adopt it by providing solutions through meaningful applications. \
</p>\
<p>\
I see myself in a position where I can have the liberty of pitching ideas and giving life to my creations, where I can learn from other programmers and leave my footprint in the tech world.\
